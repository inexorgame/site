Our Hackathon 2017 is over and we would like to provide a quick overview of what we have done at this weekend.

Once again a huge "thank you" to the [FabLab Tuebingen](https://www.fablab-neckar-alb.org) for providing this awesome location for our Hackathon!

## "Speed" Release v0.9
While we did make huge steps forward, we didn't publish the next release, since a few things are still missing to make the experience smoother. However, we will get there very soon.


## Next steps
While it is far from being decided, we might have our [next Hackathon already in February or March](https://github.com/inexorgame/inexor-core/issues/497) in 2018. We definitely don't want to wait again two long years. 😜

And in the meantime, we will continue to make the best game we can. 🎮 (And we will wear our Hackathon 2017 shirt with pride.)
